<section class="about">
    <p>Leralla Purified Water™ is a proudly black-owned Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) based in Pretoria, dedicated to providing high-quality, affordable purified bottled water.
        Our journey began with a deep concern for the inconsistent water quality and frequent water cuts in Pretoria, which inspired our directors to create a reliable and accessible solution for our community.</p>
    <p>We believe clean, safe drinking water should not be a luxury. That’s why we offer premium purified water with custom-branded labels at prices tailored for those who seek value without compromising quality.
        Using a state-of-the-art 6-stage purification process, we ensure every bottle meets the highest standards of safety and freshness.</p>
    <p>Whether for events, businesses, or everyday use, Leralla Purified Water is committed to refreshing our community while promoting affordability, sustainability, and excellence.</p>
